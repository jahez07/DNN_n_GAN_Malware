# DNN_n_GAN_Malware
 A research work for adversarial attack on pre-trained high performance model 

## Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
A generative adversarial network is a class of machine learning frameworks and prominent framework for approaching generative AI. 

Existing:
1. VGG16 Trained Model (Tm)
2. Train Set (Tr)
3. Test Set (Ts) : It has both `correctly predicted` and `incorreclty predicted` or `misclassfied`

Process:
1. Test data set is passed to the trained VGG16 Model and will only take the  `correctly predicted`    
2. The `correctly predicted` samples are now used as an input to the `Discriminator` of the GAN Model.

| S.No	| Test Samples | Actual label (VGG-16) | Predicted Label (VGG-16) | Selection |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | M1 | F1 |	F1 | 1 |	
| 2	| M2 | F2 |	F1 | `misclassfied` |			
| 3	| M3 | F1 | F1 | 3 |		
| 4 | M4 | F2 | F3 | `misclassfied` |			
| 5 | M5 | F3 | F3 | 5 |		
| 6 | M6 | F1 | F1 | 6 |
| 7 | M7 | F3 | F1 | `misclassfied` |
| 8 | M8 | F3 |	F3 | 8 |
| 9 | M9 | F3 | F3 | 9 |
| 10 | M10 | F2	| F2 |10 |	


3. The `Generator` will also be given noise of the same shape as the input image to the `Discriminator` to generate fake image that would fool the `Discriminator` and eventually balance. 
4. The generated images are now tested with the VGG16 Pre-trained model and the correctly predicted images
