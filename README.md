# DNN_n_GAN_Malware
 A research work for adversarial attack on pre-trained high performance model 

## Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
A generative adversarial network is a class of machine learning frameworks and prominent framework for approaching generative AI. 

Existing:
1. VGG16 Trained Model (Tm)
2. Train Set (Tr)
3. Test Set (Ts) : It has both `correctly predicted` and `incorreclty predicted` or `misclassfied`

Process:
1. Test data set is passed to the trained VGG16 Model and will only take the  `correctly predicted`    
2. The `correctly predicted` samples are now used as an input to the Discriminator of the GAN Model.
